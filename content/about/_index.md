My name is Simão Silva, I am 20 years old and a Computer Science and Engineering student at [Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/).
<pr>

I am currently finishing my BSc degree, where I have gained valuable knowledge in programming, computer engineering and software development techniques. My main interest areas are **Distributed Systems**, **Computer Networking** and **Ciber-Security**.

<pr>

Due to these interests, I recently started a summer internship at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/), a research institute
associated with IST. INESC-ID is a research focused organization in the fields of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering. In this internship, I will be following the work of research teams working in projects related to **Distributed Systems**, **Software-Defined Networks** (SDNs), **Network Security** and **AI/ML aplied to networks and systems**.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing sports, video games, reading books and going out with friends. I am a curious person and I take great interest in learning about Science, Engineering or Personal Development. However, I think we grow the most in hearing about other people's life stories and reflecting upon them.
