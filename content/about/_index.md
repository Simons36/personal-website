My name is Simão Silva, I am 21 years old and a Computer Science and Engineering student at [Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/).
<pr>

I am currently finishing my BSc degree, where I have gained valuable knowledge in programming, computer engineering and software development techniques. My main interest areas are **Distributed Systems**, **Computer Networking** and **Cybersecurity**.

Due to these interests, I recently started a summer internship at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/), a research institute
associated with IST. INESC-ID is a research focused organization in the fields of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering. In this internship, I will be following the work of research teams in projects related to **Distributed Systems**, **Software-Defined Networks** (SDNs), **Network Security** and **AI/ML applied to networks and systems**.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing sports, video games, reading books and going out with friends. I am a curious person and I take great interest in learning about Science, Engineering or Personal Development. I also consider myself a quite hard-working and ambicious person, and I'm looking forward to work.
