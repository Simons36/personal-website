[{"content":"My name is Simão Silva, I am 20 years old and a Computer Science and Engineering student at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST). I am currently finishing my BSc degree, where I have gained valuable knowledge in programming, computer engineering and software development techniques. My main interest areas are Distributed Systems, Computer Networking and Ciber-Security.\nDue to these interests, I recently started a summer internship at INESC-ID, a research institute associated with IST. INESC-ID is a research focused organization in the fields of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering. In this internship, I will be following the work of research teams working in projects related to Distributed Systems, Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), Network Security and AI/ML aplied to networks and systems.\nIn my spare time, I enjoy playing sports, video games, reading books and going out with friends. I am a curious person and I take great interest in learning about Science, Engineering or Personal Development. However, I think we grow the most in hearing about other people\u0026rsquo;s life stories and reflecting upon them.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"About Me","summary":"My name is Simão Silva, I am 20 years old and a Computer Science and Engineering student at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST).","title":"About Me"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"fewweff\n","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"fewweff","title":"Projects"},{"content":" My name is Simão Silva, and I\u0026rsquo;m a baschelor\u0026rsquo;s student taking Computer Science at Instituto Superior Técnico (Portugal).\nMy main interest areas are Computer Networks, Distributed Systems and Ciber-Security.\rFeel free to reach out using the links above!\rLearn more\r","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Simão Silva - Computer Science Student","summary":"My name is Simão Silva, and I\u0026rsquo;m a baschelor\u0026rsquo;s student taking Computer Science at Instituto Superior Técnico (Portugal).","title":"Simão Silva - Computer Science Student"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
